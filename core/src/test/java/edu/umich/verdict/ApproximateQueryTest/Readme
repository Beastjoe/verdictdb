Unit Test of Approximate Query

Test Unifrom, Stratified and Universe Sampling separately by running corresponding classes.
Each test class involves 4 aggregated queries: count(), sum(), avg(), count(dinstinct).
For every aggregation function, test feature:

    1. flat query(no join, group by, filter),
    2. query with filters, which have
        a. one predicate
        b. two predicates
    3. query with join two tables, where the form of join is
        a. left join
        b. right join
        c. inner join
        d. outer join
    4. query with join three tables, where the form of join is
        a. left join
        b. right join
        c. inner join
        d. outer join
    5. query with group by clause, where
        a. group by one column
        b. group by two columns
    6. Combination of 2 and 3 (4 is omitted for performance reason)
    7. Combination of 2 and 5
    8. Combination of 3 and 5
    9. Combination of 2, 3 and 5
    10. Select clause with subquery
        a. Substitute 1
        b. Substitute 2
        c. Substitute 3
        d. Substitute 5
        e. Substitute 6
        f. Substitute 7
        g. Substitute 8
        h. Substitute 9
    11. From clause with subquery
        a. Substitute 1
        b. Substitute 2
        d. Substitute 5
        f. Substitute 7
    12. Where clause with subquery
        a. Substitute 2
        b. Substitute 6
        d. Substitute 7
        f. Substitute 9
    13. Union
        a. Union of 5
        b. Union of 7
        c. Union of 9

Since the result of VerdictDB is approximate, so it is possible to fail the test.
For group-by query, it is also possible to have fewer rows than the true results.
You can set how much tolerance of deviation from the true result. The default is 10% from the true result.
