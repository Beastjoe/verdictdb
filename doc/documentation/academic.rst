Verdict is built upon the theories of approximate query processing (AQP) and our
novel architecture of AQP-as-a-middleware. Verdict's huge speedups are possible
because, even from a small fraction of the entire data, we can reliably estimate
many important statistics of the entire data. Verdict exploits that the values
of many aggregate functions that commonly appear in analytic queries can be expressed using those
statistics of the entire data, which can be estimated using samples.

Our research in approximate query processing has produced many research papers
at top-tier conferences.
